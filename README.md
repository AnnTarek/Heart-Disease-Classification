# Heart-Disease-Classification
**Objective**
The project involves developing a binary classification model using Keras to predict the presence of heart disease based on a dataset. 

**Dataset Description**

 **Steps to run the code**
1. Download the ipynb file and the dataset file. <br>
2. Upload the notebook on Colab then upload the dataset. <br>
3. Run the whole code to see the results by yourself. <br>

 **Dependencies**
 Required libraries are Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, matplotlib, sklearn, and seaborn <br>
 To download keras tuner:  <br>
 ! pip install keras-tuner --upgrade <br>
 To download tensorboard <br>
 ! pip install tensorboard <br>
 To run tensorboard open the terminal and type this command: tensorboard --logdir logs <br>
 Then tensorboard will serve on localhost.
